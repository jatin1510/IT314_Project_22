## <pre> **Identification of Model** </pre>

### Here we have chosen an Iterative Waterfall Model. 
1. Reason why we have selected: 
* Requirements and needs are mostly the same , as time being there will not be major changes in that.
* If at any phase there is something that needs to be changed , we can give feedback.
* After Deployment of a particular version , if required to do some changes then follow the same iteration. 

2. Reason for Rejection of another suitable model: 
* Incremental Model: We donâ€™t have to make different modules and work according to that and release that. 
* Spiral Model: In that major focus is on risk management.
